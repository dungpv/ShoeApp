# ShoeApp
This project is a simplified implementation of a shopping system, the project aims to provide the basic features that are expected to be found in a mobile e-commerce applicaion where users can purchase and sell products. To navigate through the app, users have to authenticate themselves. Once logged-in, users can scroll through the list of available products, add different products to the cart, and make orders. Users can also add, edit, remove their own products into the main store.
